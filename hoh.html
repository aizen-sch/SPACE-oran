                    - Spiral Galaxies: Have spiral arms extending from their centers, like the Milky Way.
                    - Elliptical Galaxies: Have an oval or spherical shape and contain old stars.
                    - Irregular Galaxies:Lack a defined shape and often result from collisions or interactions between galaxies.
                  2. Our Galaxy: The Milky Way:
                    - A spiral galaxy containing hundreds of billions of stars.
                    - Our solar system is located in one of its arms, known as the "Orion Arm."
                    - It contains a supermassive black hole at its center called "Sagittarius A."
                  3.Other Galaxies:
                    -Andromeda: The closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, located about 2.5 million light-years away.
